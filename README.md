To run the backend, use the 'dotnet run' command in the backend directory.
When the backend is running, an HTTP GET request must be send to the buildDB endpoint in order to build the database. 
Should this fail to work, ensure that an SQLite file, 'db.db' is present in the Backend/API directory.


To run the frontend, simply use 'ng serve' within the Frontend directory.
